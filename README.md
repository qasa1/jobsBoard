#Project Description#
I created this project as a challenge to learn Ruby on rails. A jobs board is a very practical application and that aspect excited me. <br><br>

My main objective with this project was to learn and understand the MVC architecture that ruby on rails follows. I used several gems like haml and simple form for this project.<br>

This project was deployed using Heroku and it's live at http://jobsboard1.herokuapp.com/
